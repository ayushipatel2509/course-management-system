Course Management System

This project is a Course Management System built using Flask and SQLite for managing student enrollments, course schedules, prerequisites, and professor assignments.
Designed as a full-stack web application, it provides separate dashboards and role-based access for students and administrators. Students can register, enroll in
available courses, and manage their schedule, while administrators can add or edit courses, assign professors, and monitor enrollments. The system enforces critical
validations such as capacity limits, schedule conflicts, and prerequisite checks, ensuring a smooth academic experience for all users. This project demonstrates
practical skills in web development, database design, and backend logic with real-world education system requirements.
